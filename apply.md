Iterative is accepting applications for the Summer 2021 (S21) batch that takes place from July to September 2021.

A few things to know before applying.

1. **Applying** – If you want to apply, please submit your application online by 8 pm SGT on July 12. Startups that submit early have a small advantage because we have more time to read their applications. And you can submit after the deadline - though keep in mind that if you apply late, we can’t guarantee the exact date of when you’ll hear back from us with a decision.
2. **Founders Only** – Only founders can come to interviews or attend batch events.
3. **Rolling Admission** – We will be inviting teams to talk to us on a rolling basis and hold final interviews at the end of every month until the batch.
4. **Remote** – Like the previous batches, this batch will be remote. It’s worked well. In fact, except for maybe the social aspect (we’re working on it), we think founders get even better advice, fundraising help, etc. in a remote batch.
6. **Speakers** – During the 3 month cycle we invite speakers every week to talk about their startup and what they learned. Previous speakers include Emmett Nicholas (Co-Founder of Airtable), Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt), Moses Lo (Co-Founder of Xendit) and many more.
7. **Group Office Hours** – Every week or two, you’ll have group office hours, where you’ll talk with 5-8 companies and your Iterative partners for an hour. These group office hours are a chance to get to know companies in your batch that are going through similar things and to help each other.
8. **Network** – During and after the batch, we introduce startups individually to people who could help them. The founders of other Iterative companies tend to be especially helpful.
9. **Demo Day** – About 12 weeks in, we organize an event called Demo Day at which the startups present to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.
10. **Stay For The Community** – Iterative doesn’t really end after 3 months. We continue to give advice and make introductions as long as our startups need—-and so does the informal network of Iterative companies. We think of our batch program as just orientation into the larger community.
