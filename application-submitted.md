Thanks for submitting your application. We will email you within a week with next steps. 

## Process

If invited, our admission process consists of the following:

1. **Call with 1st Venture Partner** – You’ll be contacted by a venture partner to learn more about what you’re working on.
2. **Call with 2nd Venture Partner** – If the 1st venture partner is positive, you’ll be contacted by a 2nd venture partner who will independently do the same. Think of this as getting a 2nd opinion.
3. **Final Interview with General Partners** – If both venture partners are positive, you'll be invited to a final interview with the general partners for a much longer conversation. We prepare for this final interview but doing extensive research on your space.
