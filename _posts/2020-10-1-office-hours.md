We're excited to host open online office hours for startup founders every Friday throughout the month of October. Office hours are 20-minute sessions between you and one of our partners, where they try to help you with your startup as much as they can. This is very similar to the partner meetings we hold with companies during the batch.

If you're in the early stages of building a company, we'd love to meet you. Please [sign up here](https://airtable.com/shrluMbWSYJzJj91C).

## How it Works

2. **Review and Invite** – We will review applications and invite you to office hours via email.
3. **Office Hours** – You will spend 20 minutes with an Iterative partner talking about a challenge you're currently facing. To make the most use of the time, we highly recommend that you come with a specific question or challenge.

## FAQs

### What is Iterative?

Iterative is a Y-Combinator style accelerator that invests USD $150K upon acceptance, works with the founders intensely on their idea before helping them fundraise at our Demo Day.

You can see our first batch of companies [here](https://iterative.vc/posts/iterative-summer-2020-batch).

### **Why are we doing this?**

We want more startups in Southeast Asia! We think more people would start companies if they had a little bit of guidance on where to start, what to work on, etc. We know this helped us a lot when we were getting started.

### Who sees my application?

Only Iterative partners.

### What kind of teams can apply?

As long as you're working on something, you're welcome to apply. You don't necessarily have to have launched, have a team, etc.

### Will you fund us?

No guarantees :) but if you would like to be seriously considered for that, we recommend you [apply to our accelerator](https://iterative.vc/apply?utm_campaign=office_hours&utm_source=event&utm_content=will-fund).
