We are excited to kick off our first virtual Country Tour. We'll be hosting talks with Iterative founders and partners who've built successful companies in their country. The primary topic will be what they wish they knew before starting a startup in their country, specifically:

- **Origin Stories** – How did they come up with their idea and how did they get started?
- **Unique Challenges** – What are the unique challenges faced by founders in their country?
- **Ecosystem** – What's holding people in their country back from being founders?

At the end of every event, we'll answer questions from founders and future founders in the audience. If you're starting a startup in one of these countries, we want to meet you at one of the events.
