    <h1 class="text-center">Seed Funding for Early Stage Startups</h1>
    <p>We invest US$150K in batches twice a year. Upon admission, we invest the full amount upfront then work with the founders closely on their idea for 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, they present to a select group of investors with the goal of raising a larger round of investment.</p>
    <p>After that, we and the alumni network continue to help the startups and founders for the lifetime of the startup and often much longer.</p>
