title: "Recommend a Founder"
---

Recommend a founder who has applied or who you think should apply to Iterative. There’s no such thing as too early, we like to get to know people as early in their journey as possible.

1. **Has Applied to Iterative** – If they have applied to Iterative, you’re recommendation will be attached to their application and be taken into consideration during the selection process. 
2. **Has Not Applied to Iterative** – If they haven't applied to Itartive, We’ll send them an email encouraging them to apply.

We take recommendations seriously. Often we’re betting on the founders more than the idea so we like to hear from people who know them well or have worked with them before. You can recommend as many founders as you like.
