Thanks for submitting your application. We will email you within a week with next steps. 

## Process

If invited, our admission process consists of the following:

1. **Call with 1st Venture Partner** – You’ll be contacted by a venture partner to learn more about what you’re working on.
2. **Call with 2nd Venture Partner** – If the 1st venture partner is positive, you’ll be contacted by a 2nd venture partner who will independently do the same. Think of this as getting a 2nd opinion.
3. **Final Interview with General Partners** – If both venture partners are positive, you'll be invited to a final interview with the general partners for a much longer conversation. We prepare for this final interview but doing extensive research on your space.

## Recommendations

Maybe more important than what the startup does is how formidable the founders are. Often that’s hard to tell without talking to them. Unfortunately we don’t have time to talk to everyone that applies. We have found that recommendations are a reasonable proxy. Good people tend have people willing to vouch for them. 

If you have people willing to recommend you, we highly recommend you ask them to do so [here]({{site.url}}/recommend). It will only take them a few minutes and will significantly help your application.
